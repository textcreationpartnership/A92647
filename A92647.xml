            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lords of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council considering, that since the Reformation and Establishment of the Protestant Religion within this Kingdom, many desperate Plots and Conspiracies have been hatch'd, and incessantly prosecuted by the Emissaries of the Pope and his Councils, to the hazard of the undermining of that glorious and blessed Structure, where-thorough not only many simple and ignorant people have been deluded and withdrawn from their holy Profession, and those principles of truth wherein they were bred and educat: But the Pillars and Foundations of Alleagiance and Obedience to the Supream Authority and Laws have been sore shaken, by saying and hearing of Mess, resseting of Iesuits and Seminary Priests, trafficking and perverting unstable souls, and setling of Superiours and other Officers depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Romish Hierarchy; by whose council and conduct, they might propagate their rebellious Principles and erronious Doctrines, which in all probability had prevailed to the great hazard of Religion, Monarchical Government, and the Peace of the Kingdom, if, by the wholsome Laws and Statutes, and pious care and endeavours of His <hi>Majesty</hi> and His Royal Ancestors, the same had not been prevented. And being informed, that notwithstanding of the late Act of this current Parliament solemnly published against Papists, Priests, and Iesuits; whereby His <hi>Majesty,</hi> to witness His Royal care of, and zeal for, the Protestant Religion, with consent of the Estates of Parliament, did command and charge all and sundry Iesuits, Priests and Trafficking Papists, to depart this Kingdom within a moneth after the publication thereof; and discharged all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to resset, supply, entertain, furnish meat or drink, or keep correspondence with any of the foresaids persons, under the pains contained in that and other former Acts of Parliament, which during the late troubles have not been put in execution against the contraveeners: Yet divers persons have come into this Kingdom with Instructions, Popish Books and Writings, and Priests Vestments, for prosecution of these abominable Practices; who (finding themselves now mightily disappointed of that great increase of their numbers and advancement of their designs, whereof they had great hopes from the late horrid confusions, introduced into Church and State by Sectaries) do again adventure to trace their old steps, and to imbroil that Order and Government restored to us by Almighty GOD. Therefore they command and charge all His <hi>Majesties</hi> Subjects of whatsoever quality or degree, to observe and obey the foresaid Act of Parliament, and all other Acts made against Priests, Iesuits and Trafficking Papists; with certification if they do otherwayes, the whole pains therein contained shall be inflicted without mercy. And ordains all Sheriffs of Shires and their Deputes, Magistrates of Burghs and other Iudges, and all Ministers of the Gospel within their respective bounds and jurisdictions, to make exact enquiry after the offenders, and to apprehend their persons and secure them in the next Prison, and immediately to give notice thereof to the Privy Council: As also, to send in yearly to the Lords of the Privy Council, a List of such persons as are known or suspected to be Papists, and to seize on all Popish Books, Writings, Commissions or Instructions, and others belonging to them which they can apprehend, conform to the hundred and ninety fourth Act of the thirteenth Parliament of King <hi>James</hi> the sixth, and other Acts and Statutes of Parliament and Privy Council made thereanent in all points, as they will be answerable under all highest pain. And ordains these presents to be forthwith printed, and published at the Mercat Crosses of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and of all other head Burghs of the Shires, that none may pretend ignorance.</p>
